[JDFIXER]<size=70%>Thanks for visiting this panel!<br>It's been quite the journey. This mod went from a tool for myself to running the games of my friends (who happen to be the world's best players lol) at BSWC 2021 only a month after initial release!<br>JDFixer wouldn't be what it is today without the ethusiasm and encouragement you all showed and shared with me.<br>What's next as we head into 2023?###
