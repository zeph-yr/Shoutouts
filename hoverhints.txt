Thanks for being loyal user and noticing this panel! The last 1.5 years has been quite the journey. This mod went from something for myself to running the games of over half of the world's best players at BSWC 2021 - only a month after initial release! JDFixer wouldn't be what it is today without the ethusiasm and encouragement that each of you showed and shared with me. TY!
