<size=70%>Thanks for opening this panel!<br>The last 1.5 years has been quite the journey. This mod went from a tool for myself to running the games of the world's best players (and my friends) at BSWC 2021 only a month after initial release!<br>JDFixer wouldn't be what it is today without the ethusiasm and encouragement that each of you showed and shared with me. TY!
